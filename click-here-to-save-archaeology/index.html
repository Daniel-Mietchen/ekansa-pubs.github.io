          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p class="lead small">
            This essay owes much to the trenchant criticism of Internet utopianism offered by Evgeny Morozov 
            in his influential book, <em>To Save Everything, Click Here</em> (2014). As such, this essay reflects on 
            some issues in the social and professional context of digital archaeology that rarely see public discussion. 
            Digital archaeology is profoundly shaped by an institutional landscape that demands the 
            commoditization, marketing, and branding of scholarship “as a service”. These forces make it 
            extraordinarily difficult to sustain substantive and reflective intellectual engagement in our 
            increasingly digitized discipline. As a strategy to overcome these issues, this paper highlights 
            why digital engagement requires much longer time scales in funding and greater professional 
            commitment to recognizing the process and conduct of research rather than rewarding only the 
            efficient production of measurable research outcomes.

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Issues surrounding the collection, management, dissemination and preservation of digital data in archaeology have gained prominence in recent years. We see wide experimentation, grant making, public policy, software development, and social media enthusiasm in different areas of archeological data management. Digital data has much promise. It can help us engage with wider communities, explore new research questions, and create and preserve a vastly enriched body of archaeological documentation. Digital data also has a certain glamour, gained in large part through its associations with the burgeoning tech industry. At conferences, digital archaeological initiatives are often marketed like tech startups. The look and feel of archaeological websites owes a great deal to styles and user interface designs coming from the commercial Web. The quickly growing field of “digital archaeology” brings freshness and excitement to archaeology.
        </p>
  
        <p>While I welcome the increasing limelight cast in areas that align with my particular research interests, I worry about the institutional context that currently surrounds digital data's growing prominence. In Kathleen Fitzpatrick's (2011) study of the dysfunctions of scholarly monographs as the sole route to tenure and promotion in many areas of the humanities, she notes how scholars rarely focus critical reflection on the institutions and tacit rules that govern their own professions. Just as we need critical focus on why scholars fail to engage with new media, we also need critical reflection on how new media become part of our profession. If digital archaeology is to really fulfill its promise and widen participation and opportunities for exploring the past, we urgently need more reflection on the forces that shape digital data in archaeology.
        </p>
  
        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>Since reflection in digital archaeology is in short supply, rather than focus specifically on my work with Open Context (<a href="http://opencontext.org" target="_blank">http://opencontext.org</a>), a data publishing service for archaeology, this essay will explore some of the institutional challenges faced by Open Context in particular and digital archaeology more generally. The perspectives offered here stem from my experience over 12 years as a dedicated “digital archaeologist,” founding and running a nonprofit endeavor to promote the dissemination and preservation of archaeological field data. Open Context is now referenced by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for data management for archaeology and the digital humanities. Its approach of “data sharing as publishing” emphasizes collaboration with dedicated editorial and information specialists to make data more intelligible and usable. Open Context publishes a wide variety of archaeological data, ranging from survey data to excavation documentation, artifact analyses, chemical analyses of artifacts, and detailed descriptions of bones and other biological remains found in archaeological contexts.
        </p>
  
        <p>The range, scale, and diversity of these data require expertise in data modeling and a commitment to continual development and iterative problem solving. Open Context has undergone several upgrades, the most recent in spring of 2015, to keep pace with technology changes and to leverage best practices in data stewardship. With data preservation through the University of California (the California Digital Library), Open Context now publishes more than 1.2 million archaeological records from projects worldwide<a id="note-orig-1" class="fnote" href="#note-1">1</a>. This is on a scale comparable to that of a major museum (for instance, the online collection of the Metropolitan Museum of New York makes some 407,000 records available). Open Context has made this remarkable achievement on a much more limited budget than the online collections of major museums. Grant funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the NEH, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, NSF, and others has gone a long way largely because of the AAI’s status as an independent non-profit organization with an overhead much, much lower than large research institutions. The AAI and Open Context have also benefited from the growth of the Web and the “ecosystem” of projects and individuals in similar roles—undertaking innovative work outside of traditional academic roles. At the same time, our vantage point outside of the tenure track offers us a different perspective on the academy and its evolution. Those perspectives inform this essay.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="sustainability">Branding and Sustainability in Digital Archaeology</h2>
        <p>As a relatively new area of specialization, digital archaeology has emerged during a time of tremendous change in the academy. While we see unfolding technological transformations that make digital archaeology possible, we also see profound and often disturbing restructuring of wider economic and political institutions that impact university funding and governance. Simply put, “neoliberalism” – a loosely associated bag of ideologies that emphasize fiscal austerity and relentless competition, market transactions, and certain management techniques centered on metrics and surveillance – now permeates academic institutions (Feller 2008; Kansa 2014).
        </p>
        
        <p>With the notable exception of the Wikipedia, commercial players dominate much of our interaction with World Wide Web. Most, if not all, digital archaeology projects must interface with the commercial Web, commercial software and other commercial platforms. Search engine optimization, marketing of digital archaeology projects on social media, and the embrace of GitHub for software (and sometimes data) version control all illustrate cross-cutting ties with the commercial tech sector. Much of the interface design, look and feel, and other aspects interactivity take their cue from the commercial tech sector. Many digital archaeology websites have familiar commercial social media icons to facilitate tweets, links to Facebook, etc. Similarly, many of the “best practices” of digital archaeology, including project management methodologies (agile, iterative), user centered design, and systems architectures (cloud computing, RESTful web service design) come directly from approaches developed in commercial settings.
        </p>
        
        <p>At the same time, many digital archaeology projects are actually built by people working on short-term academic computing contracts that may cycle between the academic and commercial sector (often called “Alt-Acs” or “Alternative Academics”). As such, Alt-Acs, typically working on short-term “soft money,” would be prudent to look toward the commercial sector as an option of the grant money does not continue to flow. Fluency in methodologies and skills demanded in the tech sector can offer Alt-Acs more employment options outside academia. All of these factors come together to make the practice and outcomes of digital archaeology seem like (low budget) commercial startups.
        </p>
        
        <p>These factors make the character of digital archaeology outputs very different from conventional academic outputs. Branding for conventional research, be they books or articles, works very differently than digital scholarship. The dominant branding factor for conventional research outputs centers on the publisher. Certain publishers carry cache and prestige, and that branding confers prestige to their authors. While branding matters, the connection between a conventional scholarly work and an individual scholar is more personal and direct. Books and articles are largely “marketed” on a researcher's CV, clearly identified as a researcher's individual accomplishments.
        </p>
        
        <p>The myopic focus of academic reward systems to reward individual accomplishments over collaborative endeavors has seen wide critique among digital humanists (Fitzpatrick 2011). Despite these critiques, digital archaeology projects usually still fall outside of normal academic recognition and reward systems. They mainly count for tenure in promotion only indirectly, either as a success in competitive granting, or as the subject of a conventional publication that sees recognition and reward. For Alt-Acs that fall outside of the tenure track, recognition comes from involvement with the project itself. As an alternative to conventional paths toward recognition, many digital archaeological projects establish their own unique brands. As is the case with commercial startups, digital humanities brands in general and digital archaeology brands in particular are expressed with domain names, logos, color palettes, font choices, etc.
        </p>
        
        <p>The issue of branding goes far beyond the mere fact that domain names and hosting are inexpensive. Rather the ubiquity of branding in digital archaeology reflects its peculiar role in the larger discipline. Although some digital archaeology projects aim to disseminate results of a specific project, many attempt to develop and market tools or services. Thus, many digital archaeology projects, though requiring their own research and development, aim to facilitate the research or outreach of others. Unlike conventional archaeological scholarship where impact is usually measured through citation, digital archaeology projects tend compete for adoption by wider communities. Branding recognition works toward that goal.
        </p>
        
        <p>The need to brand digital archaeology projects in large measure reflects an institutional context shaped by neoliberalism. Digital archaeology projects largely have short term grant financing. Generating positive buzz and recognition can improve chances for future grants. Similarly, in order to sustain digital archaeology projects (see below), many projects have adopted some sort of fee-for-service model (for tDAR see Kintigh and Altschul 2010, but applicable to Open Context also). Paying for useful services harkens back to both the market orientation and instrumentalism that help to define neoliberalism. Knowledge production has to be measurable, and ideally have practical outcomes that can be monetized. The project focus of digital archaeology similarly emphasizes instrumentalism. Most work aims to conceptualize, and if funded, build easily marketed “deliverables.” Practitioners loudly trumpet accomplishments, collaborations, new features, and new funding via social media, in a way calculated to enhance recognition for a project's brand and eventually drive sales.
        </p>
        
        <p>Making and marketing practical tools and services is not inherently bad or damaging to archaeology. After all, we absolutely should celebrate the creation of good tools and services that help archaeologists achieve research, public outreach, and other goals more effectively. However, I note the issue of branding to highlight a key concern – namely, is digital archaeology to be scholarship in its own right or is it to be a niche area for (semi)commercial services? At what point do marketing and branding imperatives become self-serving goals unto themselves? How does marketing buzz impact the way we understand and evaluate the scholarship encoded in digital archeology?
        </p>
        
        <p>The current framing of “sustainability” centers around organizational and project continuity made possible by clever business models that market some sort of service for fees. Ideas about what sustainability means and how we should attain it draws very heavily from neoliberalism. Grants can be seen as a type of no-interest venture capital loan. They get projects going, but then it is up to the project to maintain itself. Success means a project (and its associated institution) has enough continued income to grow via non-grant sources of support.
        </p>
        
        <p>The clearest example of this vision of sustainability is the online journal repository, JSTOR. JSTOR started with grant funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in 1995 and first launched its online services in 1997. In subsequent years, JSTOR's developers founded Ithaka, a nonprofit corporation to sustain and manage JSTOR. In many ways, JSTOR represents a singular success. It offers invaluable services to the scholarly community (that can afford institutional subscriptions) and now does so without depending on grant-based financing. In 2004, Donald Waters, a Mellon Foundation program officer, discussed how JSTOR came to be such a dominant player in digital scholarship, stating that “designing resources to take advantage of the economies of scale inherent in the digital environment is critical to sustainability” (Waters 2004). He also lamented the jumbled fragmentation of scholarly resources developed by many small and one-off projects (Waters 2004).
        </p>
        
        <p>Is this vision of sustainability always desirable? One danger may be the encouragement of monopolies or oligarchies where “sustainability” is not just a means to an end (some sort of public service), but an end unto itself. Dominating a market and crowding out rivals is surely sustainable. Effectively, because JSTOR is so dominant, commands so much scholarly attention, and has contractual agreements with so many publishers and libraries<a id="note-orig-2" class="fnote" href="#note-2">2</a>, it would be very difficult for others to build alternative discovery services, indexes and interfaces to the content now delivered by JSTOR. One can imagine feminist or African American scholars developing special discovery, presentation, and text analysis tools as alternative ways of understanding and exploring the content now in JSTOR. However, I cannot see how such alternative JSTORs could now be financed, launched and sustained. Thus, while JSTOR offers excellent services, these services come with opportunity costs.
        </p>
        
        <p>The example of JSTOR informs some of my concerns with the future of digital data in US archaeology. Another Mellon Foundation funded effort, Digital Antiquity, with its tDAR repository is working to offer key and absolutely necessary digital preservation services for US archaeology. Like similar large-scale, long-term projects, Digital Antiquity must develop a sustainable business model for its services. In doing so, it has some parallels as well as some important differences with JSTOR. First, unlike JSTOR, Digital Antiquity has largely adopted “open data” policies (see below).  tDAR imposes some access restrictions because of the sensitive nature of some of its data, but is otherwise very open with data. Nevertheless, a proven method to gain sustainability would be to work toward the scale and institutional positioning achieved by JSTOR, a strategy outlined by Waters (2004):
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>There is as yet on the horizon no real substitute for the vision, discipline, and commitment needed to build digital collections at a scale and level of generality that will attract a broad audience of users and have such an impact on scholarship that their disappearance is not an option.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>JSTOR succeeded in amassing a collection so large and comprehensive that one cannot be an effective researcher in many fields without JSTOR access. Similarly, if Digital Antiquity succeeds in developing a comprehensive archive of American archaeology, it will be in a powerful position to become a similarly essential resource for the discipline.
        </p>
        
        <p>Waters' emphasis on scale and centrality to explicitly achieve a JSTOR-like “lock-in” has potential drawbacks. Though it probably does lead to the long-term continuity of a given effort, it can also result in the crowding out of other programs, thereby inhibiting exploration of other paths toward innovation and other ways of organizing and representing digital scholarship. For example, Open Context has taken a very different (but complementary) route to managing and disseminating archaeological data than tDAR or other repositories. Open Context publishes digital data as granular Web resources (“one URL per potsherd”). This facilitates new opportunities to explore Linked Open Data approaches toward networking archaeological information. But it also represents something of a challenge to interface with a repository, since most repositories (including tDAR) have different expectations about data organization and granularity. Nevertheless, we were able to collaborate with the California Digital Library (CDL) to arrange repository services that could accommodate the granularity of Open Context's resources. The fact that the CDL could tailor repository services to our specific needs allows us to explore different approaches to data curation while meeting preservation responsibilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>Fortunately, recent collaborations between Digital Antiquity, Open Context, and the Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) project demonstrate that JSTOR like lock-in is not inevitable in digital archaeology. The DINAA project, led by Joshua Wells and David G. Anderson, uses Open Context to publish archaeological site file data curated by state officials with geospatial and other sensitive information redacted (Wells et al. 2014). In close collaboration with Adam Brin at Digital Antiquity, we recently cross-referenced the DINAA site file records with certain metadata records in tDAR using Linked Open Data approaches. Open data practice adopted by both Open Context and tDAR (see below), as well as technologies such as APIs (Application Program Interfaces) and Linked Open Data that facilitate rich exchanges of data can promote meaningful collaboration between distributed projects and collections. These same APIs and Linked Open Data methods would similarly allow completely new and independent projects to build upon tDAR and Open Context managed resources in novel ways.
        </p>
        
        <p>Archaeology needs a thriving information ecosystem with many teams engaged in innovative projects. A diversity of perspectives should be seen as a “feature” rather than a “bug” because archaeological data management issues involve significant theoretical, practical and technological challenges. These intellectual challenges are as rich and deep as any other archaeological research question, necessitating a wide variety of perspectives and experiments. We should not sacrifice community-wide engagement and participation in digital archaeology in order to make one specific program “sustainable,” however worthy it may be. Thus, part of our evaluation of digital archaeology projects should focus on how such projects promote and facilitate new and independent approaches. Developing institutional supports that promote the future work of others rather than our own parochial branded interests represents a key challenge for digital archaeology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
