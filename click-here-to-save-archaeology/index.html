          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p class="lead small">
          This essay owes much to the trenchant criticism of Internet utopianism offered by Evgeny Morozov 
          in his influential book, To Save Everything, Click Here (2014). As such, this essay reflects on 
          some issues in the social and professional context of digital archaeology that rarely see public discussion. 
          Digital archaeology is profoundly shaped by an institutional landscape that demands the 
          commoditization, marketing, and branding of scholarship “as a service”. These forces make it 
          extraordinarily difficult to sustain substantive and reflective intellectual engagement in our 
          increasingly digitized discipline. As a strategy to overcome these issues, this paper highlights 
          why digital engagement requires much longer time scales in funding and greater professional 
          commitment to recognizing the process and conduct of research rather than rewarding only the 
          efficient production of measurable research outcomes.
